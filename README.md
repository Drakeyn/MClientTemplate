# MClientTemplate
A Duck Game Client-side mod template with many useful systems

This is a fairly large project, intended to cover all of the small, annoying systems 
that people often have to implement themselves when creating mods for Duck Game.

Specifically, this project currently contains:

- Simple reflection-based event system + a large amount of built-in events.
- Automatic DLL Loader system.
- Full polygon rendering system.
- Simple & easy UI system.
- Class exposer utilities for easy access to private Duck Game classes & fields
- Easy-to-use Harmony Patching via attributes.
- Easy-to-use settings system via attributes.
- Easy-to-use input system.

I have attempted to document the code and provide examples for how to use things,
located in src/MTemplate, and I have also created [Overview Documentation](https://github.com/Drakeyn/MClientTemplate/wiki) on Github.
